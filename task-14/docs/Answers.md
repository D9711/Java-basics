14.1.1
The superclass Device must have the method defined

14.1.2
The subclass method will be executed (Printer)

14.1.3
The lines will compile and the String will save the objects classname and HasCode in hexadecimal form (there is a default tostring method)

14.1.4
Same result as above, it will compile and print the objects classname and HasCode in hexadecimal form (It uses the default tostring method)

14.1.5
Yes it will compile, the for each loop will iterate over each object in mylist and print the object. Because we override the tostring method it will print the tostring specified in the tostring method we have created instead of the default tostring method.
